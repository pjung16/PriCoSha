# PriCoSha

PriCoSha is a system for privately sharing content items among groups of people. PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a userâ€™s personal information. The focus of the project will be on storing data about the content, allowing users to specify who can see and/or modify what.
